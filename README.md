Utility code for reading a data model in DMCAR format and expressing it in (Mermaid)[https://mermaid.js.org/intro/] (ERD)[https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/entityRelationshipDiagram.html] language.

DMCAR is a data modelling expression format that enables domains, models, classes, attributes and relationships to be recorded within the domain of entity-relationship modelling.

Mermaid is a diagramming language that enables markup to be converted into diagram images. Of the many diagramming styles it supports, this utility currently targets only the (ERD flavour)[https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/entityRelationshipDiagram.html].
